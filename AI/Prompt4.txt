Write me a Python app named "Sound Font Generator".  Use libraries as necessary.  I prefer argparse.  Also break things up into functions so that this app can also be called externally as a library.

Get the following information from the user:

string for Config File.
string for Output Folder.
string for Project Name.
string for Author Name.
string for Blade Color.
number for Light Effect.
number for Blade Style.
number for On Speed.
number for Off Speed.

If Output Folder is undefined, use the current folder.

Name an integer next_color_entry and give it the value of 1.
Name an integer found_line and give it the value of 0.

If the Config File doesn't exist or is undefined, create a new file named "config.ini" in the current folder.  Otherwise, parse the Config File for the last line starting with "Color-" followed by a number.  If found, set next_color_entry to the number found plus 1 and set found_line to the line number.  If not found, set found_line to the last line number in the Config File.


Create an output string with the following settings:

"Color-" + next_color_entry + "=(" + Blade Color + ")," + Light Effect + "," + On Speed + "," + Off Speed + "," + Blade Style

For example, it should look something like this:
Color-1=(0,0,255),1,500,1000,0


Create a new line in the Config File following line number: found_line.  Write the output string to this new line.


If Project Name is defined, create a new file in the Output Folder named after the Project Name with a .txt file extension write a string to the file with the following formatting:

"“" + Project Name + "” © " + Author Name if defined + Day Month Year + "."

For example:

“Buzz” © Bees 14 May 2023.
