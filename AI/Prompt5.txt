Write me a Python app named "Sound Bender".  Use libraries as necessary.  I prefer argparse.  Also break things up into functions so that this app can also be called externally as a library.  This will be run under Windows 11.

Get the following information from the user:

String for Input File.
Option for Reverse.
Number for Pitch Adjustment.
Number for Pitch Divisions.
String for Output Prefix.
String for Output Folder.

Once started, new files will be generated in the Output Folder.  These files will be named using the Output Prefix followed by parenthesis containing the number of the file, starting at 1.  The file names will end with a .wav file extension.  For example, if "blah" is specified as the Output Prefix and 3 files are generated, the files would be named: "blah(1).wav", "blah(2).wav", "blah(3).wav".  Also, the files specified may be mono or stereo audio.

The newly generated files will have changes made as specified.  If Pitch Divisions is defined, the Pitch Adjustment will be divided by the Pitch Divisions minus one and the product will be used for pitch adjustments.  For example, if 300 is specified as the Pitch Adjustment and 3 is specified for Pitch Divisions, 3 files would generate.  In this example, the first file would have normal, unmodified pitch.  The second file would have a pitch adjustment of 150 and the third file would have a pitch adjustment of 300.  When the pitch is adjusted, the audio length (tempo) must remain the same as the source file.

If the Reverse option is specified, all output file's audio will be reversed.
