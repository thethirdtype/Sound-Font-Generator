Write me a Python app named "Sound Font Generator".  Use libraries as necessary.

Get the following information from the user:

Necessary string for Input File.
Option for Reverse.
Optional number for Pitch Adjustment.
Optional number for Pitch Divisions.
Necessary string for Output Prefix.
Necessary string for Output Folder.

Once started, new files will be generated in the Output Folder.  These files will be named using the Output Prefix followed by parenthesis containing the number of the file, starting at 1.  The file names will end with a .wav file extension.  For example, if "blah" is specified as the Output Prefix and 3 files are generated, the files would be named: "blah(1).wav", "blah(2).wav", "blah(3).wav".

The newly generated files will have changes made as specified.  If Pitch Divisions is defined, the Pitch Adjustment will be divided by the Pitch Divisions minus one and the product will be used for pitch adjustments.  For example, if 300 is specified as the Pitch Adjustment and 3 is specified for Pitch Divisions, 3 files would generate.  In this example, the first file would have normal, unmodified pitch.  The second file would have a pitch adjustment of 150 and the third file would have a pitch adjustment of 300.

If Reverse is checked, all output files will be reversed.
