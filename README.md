# Sound Font Generator
The main objective of this project is to develop versatile tools that simplify the creation of Sound Fonts for lightsabers, including Xenopixel Lightsabers. These tools provide a range of functionalities, such as adjusting pitch across multiple sound files while preserving speed, updating the config.ini file with the required parameters, enabling audio reversal, and offering a palette for convenient selection and previewing of blade colors.
