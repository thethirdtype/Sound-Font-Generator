# Sound Font Generator
The main objective of this project is to develop versatile tools that simplify the creation of Sound Fonts for lightsabers, including Xenopixel Lightsabers. These tools provide a range of functionalities, such as adjusting pitch across multiple sound files while preserving speed, updating the config.ini file with the required parameters, enabling audio reversal, and offering a palette for convenient selection and previewing of blade colors.

## From the developer
This is a bit of a passion project and sort of an experiment.  At least, to kick off the project, I’ve spent much time paired programming with AI such as GPT 3.5.  This has helped me push the project forward in areas where I’m deficient, such as audio manipulation.  I’m learning how to compose more efficient AI prompts as well.  I believe that the future of software development will rely heavily on AI and understanding how to use it like a tool is like knowing how to use a calculator to solve complex mathematical problems.  It saves a lot of time.
