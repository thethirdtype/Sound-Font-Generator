# Sound Font Generator
The main objective of this project is to develop versatile tools that simplify the creation of Sound Fonts for lightsabers, including Xenopixel Lightsabers. These tools provide a range of functionalities, such as adjusting pitch across multiple sound files while preserving speed, updating the config.ini file with the required parameters, enabling audio reversal, and offering a palette for convenient selection and previewing of blade colors.

## From the developer
In this personal endeavor, I've embarked on a fascinating journey, experimenting with the integration of AI, specifically GPT 3.5. Collaborating with AI through paired programming has proven invaluable, particularly in areas where my expertise falls short, such as audio manipulation. Along the way, I'm honing my skills in crafting efficient AI prompts. I firmly believe that the future of software development relies heavily on harnessing AI's potential, much like using a calculator for complex math, an efficiency that I'm eager to explore further.
